# 📘 Conditional Statements in Python 

Welcome to the second module of our Python course at St. Ignatius College, focusing on Conditional Statements. This module is crucial for making decisions in your programs and executing code based on certain conditions.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- [Theory](./theory): This folder contains all the theoretical materials related to simple data types in Python.
- [Examples](./examples): Here you can find example problems and their solutions to understand the practical implementation of the concepts covered.
- [Exercises](./exercises): Here you can find exercises to practice your understanding of the topics covered.
- [Solutions](./solutions): This folder contains solutions to the exercises. It's recommended to try solving the exercises yourself before checking the solutions.

## 📝 Overview

In this module, you will learn how to control the flow of your Python programs using conditional statements. We will cover everything from basic `if` statements to more complex nested conditions and logical operators.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Understanding Conditional Statements 🤔

Learn the basics of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements and how they are used to control program execution based on different conditions.

### 2. Comparison Operators 🔍

Grasp how to use comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` to compare values in Python.

### 3. Logical Operators 🧠

Delve into logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`, and understand how to combine them with conditional statements.

### 4. Nested Conditional Statements 📦

Discover how to use conditional statements within other conditional statements to create complex decision-making structures.

### 5. Short Circuiting ⚡

Understand how Python optimizes conditions with `and` and `or` operators by stopping the evaluation as soon as the outcome is determined.

### 6. Ternary Operator ⚖️

Get to know the shorthand syntax for writing simple conditional statements in a single line of code.

### 7. Truthiness and Falsiness 🆚

Explore how Python evaluates non-Boolean values in conditional statements and the concept of truthiness and falsiness.

### 8. Best Practices 🏅

Learn tips for writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic conditional statements.
